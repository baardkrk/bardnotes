During the work on my masters thesis, and the course UNIK4690 at UiO, I learned a lot about the things mentioned in the title, but when I'm not using them actively it's easy to forget. So, in this post I'll try to compile the knowledge I have about them in my own words. As I'm writing this, I'm also using some external resources that I'll [link][1] to.

**Rasterisation** is the technical term describing the process of translating a 3D point(s) to a 2D array (i.e. a pixel in an image).
